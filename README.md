# Bots by mastyra
This is a collection of my poorly written code that I wrote for discord.py bots for the Attorney Online platform.

## Development
### Requirements
You need the latest version of the [latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You will also need [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html).

Please set the required IDs and tokens where they appear in the code, then you can start the bot by running:
```bash
python bot.py
```
or
```bash
python3 bot.py
```
